# Prints a short story about a fish

print('Once upon a time there was a small lonely fish.')
print('It was not like other fish. It swam in the air, high above the seas.')
print('It drifted along wind gusts and rested on clouds.')
print('One day, a terrible storm tore through the fish\'s skies.')
print('The air was turbulent and crackling with electricity.')
print('The fish fought to stay in the sky, but the storm proved too strong for it. It fell to the sea below.')
print('But now, back in the seas the fish was not alone.')
print('It swam with schools along currents and watched the storm pass by safe and sound.')
